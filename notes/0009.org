* [[https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number][Palindromic Number]]

This is a bad question. Negative numbers can also be palindromes but this
problem apparently wants us to treat the integer parameter as a string and then
check for palindrome-ness.

** =ITERATION-1=
There is no need to reverse the whole number. Reversing just half of it is
enough:

1. If there are an even number of digits, both halves are equal
2. Odd digit counts means =reversed/10= is the same as =input=
