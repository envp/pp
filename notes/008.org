* [[https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/][String to Integer (atoi)]]

This question asks us to convert a given string to an integer, assuming the
machine runnning the code has no support for integer types wider than 32 bits.

Since this write-up comes after my submitting the solution, instead of running
along with the implementation (as has been tradition till now), I'll jump into
implementation details.

** Implementation

From what the problem suggests we're to parse an integer prefixed with spaces
and a sign. So we're to write the write the state machine to capture:
=/^\s*((-|+)?\d+)/=. The only other trick is to check for overflow on the fly,
while constructing the numbers.

There isn't much else to do here.
