* [[https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-height-trees][Minimum Height Trees]]

The question gives us a undirected acyclic graph, one with tree characteristics
i.e. there is only 1 path between any two vertices and asks us to pick a root
vertex to minimize the resulting tree height.

** Intuition

The resulting tree has to be 'balanced', if you think about it carefully. This
would mean that we need to find a vertex that is equidistant from all leaves.

The next step needed help, but we can extend our "two-pointer" tactics for
solving this too.

All the discovered leaves have 'pointers' on them, and we move inward till
we have no more edges to traverse. Because there is only one path between two
vertices, there are no shortcut edges, so we can keep doing this till we have 1
or 2 vertices remaining to process.
